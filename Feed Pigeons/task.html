<h2>Feed Pigeons</h2>
<p>
 I start to feed one of the pigeons.
    A minute later two more fly by and a minute after that another 3.
    Then 4, and so on (Ex: 1+2+3+4+...). One portion of food lasts a pigeon for a minute,
    but in case there's not enough food for all the birds, the pigeons who arrived first ate first.
    Pigeons are hungry animals and eat without knowing when to stop.
    If I have
 <strong>
  N
 </strong>
 portions of bird feed, how many pigeons will be fed with at least one portion of wheat?

 This task illustrates how we can model various situations.
    Of course, the model has a limited approximation, but often-times we don't need a perfect model.
