<h2>How to Find Friends</h2>
<p>
 Sophia's drones are not soulless and stupid drones; they can make and have friends.
    In fact, they already are working for the their own social network just for drones!
    Sophia has received the data about the connections between drones and she wants to know more about relations between them.
</p>
<p>
 We have an array of straight connections between drones.
    Each connection is represented as a string with two names of friends separated by hyphen.
    For example: "dr101-mr99" means what the
 <em>
  dr101
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  mr99
 </em>
 are friends.
    Your should write a function that allow determine more complex connection between drones.
    You are given two names also. Try to determine if they are related through common bonds by any depth.
    For example: if two drones have a common friends or friends who have common friends and so on.

<p>
 Let's look at examples:
 <br/>
 <em>
  scout2
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  scout3
 </em>
 have the common friend
 <em>
  scout1
 </em>
 so they are related.
 <em>
  super
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  scout2
 </em>
 are related through
 <em>
  sscout
 </em>
 ,
 <em>
  scout4
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  scout1
 </em>
 .
    But
 <em>
  dr101
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  sscout
 </em>
 are not related.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Three arguments: Information about friends as a tuple of strings; first name as a string;
    second name as a string.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 Are these drones related or not as a boolean.
</p>

  <strong>
   Example:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <pre class="brush: python">
check_connection(
    ("dr101-mr99", "mr99-out00", "dr101-out00", "scout1-scout2",
     "scout3-scout1", "scout1-scout4", "scout4-sscout", "sscout-super"),
    "scout2", "scout3") == True
check_connection(
    ("dr101-mr99", "mr99-out00", "dr101-out00", "scout1-scout2",
     "scout3-scout1", "scout1-scout4", "scout4-sscout", "sscout-super"),
    "dr101", "sscout") == False
    </pre>
</div>

 <strong>
  How it is used:
 </strong>
 This concept will help you find not too obvious connections with the building of bond networks.
    And how to work social networks.
